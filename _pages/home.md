      excerpt: "Des Saravanan has been my direct manager at Intel for the past
      16 months. Des is by far the best manager I've had in my many years of
      work. He is very supportive,  direct,  honest,  driven and focused on the
      organizations goals. He's also very flexible when needed,  we had some
      changes in direction and he managed those efficiently and openly. He's
      very driven and is results oriented - encourages his staff to take risks,
      push themselves,  expand their roles. It was easy for us to do this
      because we knew we had his support and backing. Des has a very good
      technical grasp and can therefore talk/communicate with a wide variety of
      levels from execs to engineers. He's lead and directed very global teams
      in a very effective way. He fosters transparency,  and is very direct and
      fair in his communication. Des was a strong leader/director for his staff
      of managers,  and allowed them to autonomously lead their teams,  while
      still driving cohesive goals and results for the organization. Any team
      would be very lucky to have Des in their group,  as their leader and
      director. Des built one of the most amazing,  cohesive,  smart,  driven
      groups I have ever worked for. I knew this was an amazing group and it's
      even more evident now that I've moved into a different role."

      excerpt: "Des is a great team builder,  able to strike a good balance
      between clock-work execution and innovation exploration. At Intel,  Des
      has built a good technically strong team with transparency and execution
      urgency. The team camaraderie is exceptionally noticeable."

      title: "Sam Farsad, General Partner - Technology, Union Point Advisors"
      excerpt: "Excellent engineering manager,  understands how to work with and
      for the team. Technically sound and can help employees readily get around
          obstacles and continue to maintain focus on the customer
          feature/problem/deliverable."
reco_surekha:
    - title: "Surekha Gupta, Sr. Engineering Program Manager, Ericsson"
      excerpt: "Des was a great manager with ability to recognize and nurture
      his team’s strength; and encouraged open communication and effective
      conflict-resolution within his team. His depth of technical knowledge
      helped him make quick/tough decisions in order to meet schedules without
      compromising quality. During my time at Consentry Networks he helped me
      grow in both my technical and interpersonal abilities and I would love to
      work with him again"
reco_matt:
    - title: "Matt Peters, Director, Technical Operations at FireEye, Inc."
      excerpt: "I worked directly for Des for a over two years. During that time
      I grew to respect him as one of the best bossed I have had. In a fast
      moving company where customer requests and issues were constantly inbound,
      he had the ability to prioritize them quickly and insulate his team from
      the constant flux. In so doing,  he made on-time delivery a reality,  and
      helped the product get out the door.
      In addition,  he was able to deal with each team member individually,
      based on their strengths and weaknesses in such a way that a real team was
      built. Des encouraged people to help each other,  and to ask for help,  in
      an environment that led to the construction of a real team.
      It was a pleasure to work for him."
