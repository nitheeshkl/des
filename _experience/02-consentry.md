ConSentry was building next generation Ethernet appliances (CS2400 and CS1000)
and switches (CS4048 and CS4024) which natively integrated switching and
routing with identity and application firewall capabilities. The product is
built using PowerPC and Linux for the control plane and a proprietary
multi-core processor with 192 CPUs for L4-L7 processing and Broadcom L2-L3
switch chips for data plane. Joined as the first software development manager
and delivered all of the products from concepts to the customer acceptance
phase. The LanShield CS4048X wiring-closet switch won Interop 2006 Best of
Show. 

* Managed the platforms software development team both directly as well as
through another first line manager. Platforms team was responsible for
diagnostics, hardware and OS bring-up, drivers, multi-core processor bring-up
and its system API infrastructure, L2 switching (vlans, link aggregation, STP,
igmp snooping, qos, mac security, acl, etc), L3 routing (static, RIP, OSPF,
VRRP), management (via CLI, SNMP, Web and NMS) and all other features needed
for switch/appliance like PoE. The team also took care of infrastructure like
process monitoring, health checks, high availability, etc.

* Managed the applications software development team directly. This team was
responsible for NAC, End point security, AAA, User identification and
authentication (Kerberos, Captive Portal, 802.1x, etc.), L4-L7
Application/Protocol identification irrespective of port, protocol by basing on
the protocol traffic content, L7 and L7+ visualization, L4-L7 role based access
policy (a.k.a. application firewall) management and enforcement in the datapath
for granular control like allow, deny, rate shaping and mirroring of
application against user roles.

* Managed the QA team through a manager both directly as well as through
another first line manager. QA team was responsible for the overall QA of the
all the products (hardware, embedded software and network management software).
Focused on more QA automation test suits and test planning strategies and tools
to optimize the delivery of the quality. Successfully improved quality on
release over release.

* Responsible for working with all the vendors for purchase and integration of
the software components like Monta Vista and WindRiver for Linux,
Level7/Broadcom for the L2/L3 switch software stack, Hifn Software stack for

* Managed the release management and engineering tools/services team. Defined
and implement the processes and metrics needed for software development, source
code control, QA, defect management and release management resulting in
demonstrable and measurable quality in the field. An ecosystem was built with
Wiki, CVS, Bugzilla, Testlink, automation test scripts and release management
scripts.

* Outsourced and managed the tech publications team resulting in cost
reduction. Multiple revisions of 9 documentation suites delivered for hardware
and software products.
